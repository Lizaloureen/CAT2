Project Summary - Student 150467

This project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java, including:  

- Encapsulation** through private attributes, getters, setters, and validation to enforce data protection.  
- method Overloading & Overriding** by implementing multiple versions of a method and redefining behavior in subclasses.  
- xception Handling** with `try-catch-finally` to prevent errors like division by zero.  
How to Run
- Ensure Java is installed.  
- Navigate to the project folder and compile each file.  
- Run the programs using `javac` and `java` commands.  

Contributions
The code is open for modification and expansion to explore more OOP concepts.
